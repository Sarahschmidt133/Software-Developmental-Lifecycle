# To interpret user needs, you will need to start with a system analysis. This will get feedback from older users. The specific inputs as well as the outputs.
#A user story will help the agile team figure out what the customer wants the end user to do. It also helps the developer and tester to mark any errors from their code.

# to do this, id say that you'd want to follow the Agile-Scrum method closely while working. This means to know which task you are on, and to follow up with meetings.

# I feel like being a good team member in any tech company is to be open to new ideas. We all code differently even if there's a way that the company has. You need to be open to change and for people to listen to each other.
